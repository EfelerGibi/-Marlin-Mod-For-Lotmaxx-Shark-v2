I didnt like how the Lotmaxx Shark V2 was configured, so i modified the firmware and improved how the printer was configured.
    
      Input shaping and linear advance is on by default, screen may not start when on first start, but after a replug it works.

Additional documentation can be found at the [Marlin Home Page](https://marlinfw.org/).
Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!
