I didnt like how the Lotmaxx Shark V2 was configured, so i modified the firmware and improved how the printer was configured. 
    

Additional documentation can be found at the [Marlin Home Page](https://marlinfw.org/).
Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Building Marlin 2.1 For Lotmaxx Shark V2

To build Marlin 2.1 you'll need [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

### Supported Platforms

## Submitting Patches

Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the ([bugfix-2.1.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.1.x)) branch.

- This branch is for fixing bugs and integrating any new features for the duration of the Marlin 2.0.x life-cycle.
- Follow the [Coding Standards](https://marlinfw.org/docs/development/coding_standards.html) to gain points with the maintainers.
- Please submit Feature Requests and Bug Reports to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/new/choose). Support resources are also listed there.
- Whenever you add new features, be sure to add tests to `buildroot/tests` and then run your tests locally, if possible.
  - It's optional: Running all the tests on Windows might take a long time, and they will run anyway on GitHub.
  - If you're running the tests on Linux (or on WSL with the code on a Linux volume) the speed is much faster.
  - You can use `make tests-all-local` or `make tests-single-local TEST_TARGET=...`.
  - If you prefer Docker you can use `make tests-all-local-docker` or `make tests-all-local-docker TEST_TARGET=...`.

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## Administration

Regular users can open and close their own issues, but only the administrators can do project-related things like add labels, merge changes, set milestones, and kick trolls. The current Marlin admin team consists of:

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
